# How to use?

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your computer, this is just for the server and is not neccessary for your friends to download it.

After you've downloaded [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), simply open up your terminal and paste this:

```
node index.js
```

This will start a local server on port 3000

If you're going to use this with your friends, you have to do some port-forwarding and you have to change the source code of <b>vs-ui</b>.

After that, you're basically done! Now you can either compile it yourself or download the GUI from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/BoraOfficial/Netstress/releases/)

<b>Good luck in your cybersecurity journey!</b>
